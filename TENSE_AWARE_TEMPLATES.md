# Tense-Aware Templates Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds tense-aware template support to the SimpleThink system using winkNLP's morphological features. The system can now generate templates like `[NOUN-VERB1:participle-NOUN]` to produce "cat eating mouse" vs `[NOUN-VERB1:past-NOUN]` to produce "cat ate mouse".

## Key Features

### 1. Morphological Feature Extraction
- **winkNLP Integration**: Uses winkNLP's built-in morphological features when available
- **Fallback System**: Gracefully falls back to token-based inference when morphological info isn't provided
- **Supported Features**:
  - Verbs: `participle` (eating), `past` (ate), `present_3rd` (eats), `base` (eat)
  - Adjectives: `comparative` (bigger), `superlative` (biggest), `base` (big)

### 2. Enhanced Word Storage
- **Original Form**: Stores the original token as it appeared in text
- **Morphological Feature**: Stores the morphological feature from winkNLP
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing words continue to work without changes

### 3. Template System Enhancements
- **Morphological Matching**: Templates can specify morphological features like `VERB:participle`
- **Fallback Logic**: Falls back to regular POS matching when morphological features don't match
- **New POS Types**: Added support for morphological variants in the POS type system

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **`src/lib/nlp.ts`**
   - Added `morphFeatures` to `AnalysisResult` interface
   - Enhanced `analyzeText()` to extract morphological features
   - Added `inferMorphFromToken()` helper function

2. **`src/types/index.ts`**
   - Added `originalForm` and `morphFeature` to `WordNode` interface
   - Extended `POS` type to include morphological variants

3. **`src/lib/semanticGraphLite.ts`**
   - Enhanced `upsertWord()` to store morphological features
   - Added morphological feature extraction from POS tags

4. **`src/lib/ingest.ts`**
   - Updated ingestion pipeline to pass morphological features
   - Enhanced word creation with morphological information

5. **`src/lib/promptEngine.ts`**
   - Added `parseMorphSpecifier()` helper function
   - Enhanced template filling with morphological matching
   - Added fallback logic for when morphological features don't match

6. **`src/components/TemplateEditor.tsx`**
   - Added morphological POS options to the template editor
   - Extended POS_ORDER array with morphological variants

### Template Examples

#### Verb Templates
```typescript
// Participle form
[NOUN VERB:participle NOUN] → "cat eating mouse"

// Past tense form  
[NOUN VERB:past NOUN] → "cat ate mouse"

// Present 3rd person
[NOUN VERB:present_3rd NOUN] → "cat eats mouse"
```

#### Adjective Templates
```typescript
// Comparative form
[ADJ:comparative NOUN] → "bigger cat"

// Superlative form
[ADJ:superlative NOUN] → "biggest cat"
```

## Usage

### Creating Tense-Aware Templates

1. **In Template Editor**: Select morphological POS options like `VERB:participle` or `ADJ:comparative`
2. **Manual Entry**: Type templates like `[NOUN VERB:past NOUN]`
3. **Programmatic**: Create templates with morphological slot descriptors

### Template Filling Logic

The system follows this priority order:
1. **Locked Words**: Use explicitly locked words first
2. **Morphological Match**: Find words with matching morphological features
3. **Base POS Match**: Fall back to regular POS matching
4. **Word Bank**: Use predefined word bank as final fallback

### Backward Compatibility

- Existing templates continue to work unchanged
- Words without morphological features work normally
- System gracefully handles missing morphological information

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests:
- `morphological.test.ts`: Tests morphological feature extraction and storage
- `templateMorphological.test.ts`: Tests template filling with morphological features

## Success Criteria Met

✅ `[NOUN-VERB1:participle-NOUN]` generates "cat eating mouse", "cat chasing mouse"  
✅ `[NOUN-VERB1:past-NOUN]` generates "cat ate mouse", "cat chased mouse"  
✅ Existing templates continue to work unchanged  
✅ System uses winkNLP morphological features when available  
✅ Graceful fallback when morphological info isn't provided  

## Future Enhancements

- Support for more morphological features (plurals, possessives, etc.)
- Enhanced morphological inference for edge cases
- Integration with more advanced NLP models
- Template suggestions based on available morphological features
